Scan Summary for scanme.nmapseminar.org using Nmap version 7.97 on Wednesday, August 7th, at 10:36 AM UTC with a completion time of approximately 11 seconds across one host that was up and reachable within the network's latency range (time difference between source and target).

The scan identified several open ports on the Linux-based system running Apache httpd version 2.4.7 over TCP/IP as follows: Port 22 for SSH, which is a common service allowing remote server management; port 53 used by DNS services (in this case dnsmasq); and HTTP protocols available at ports 80 and 443 using the Apache webserver software that were also open.

Furthermore, Nmap detected an uncommon TCP-based service named nping running on port 9929 which is used for probes to measure network latency/delay or as a way of testing services (nping echo). Ports range from common miscellaneous protocols like MSPacket and MSRPC, though these were filtered due to state reasons. Also present are TCPWrapped on port 31337 indicating that the service responded but was not properly configured since it is often associated with malicious services (e.g., DDoS bots).

Noteworthy misconfigurations include: The closed ports range from MSRPC to microsoft-ds, and all of these are part of a Microsoft ecosystem which might suggest outdated or unsupported software versions that could be vulnerable in different ways. TCP Wrapped service also indicates potential security issues on port 31337 if it were misconfigured for malicious activity (as often seen with DDoS bots and other unwanted services). Additionally, the use of Nping echo is unconventional as this tool serves specific functions that don't align traditionally with network infrastructure roles.

For further reference on security issues or possible vulnerabilities associated specifically to identified open ports/services (like potential for brute-force attacks at port 22, and the risks of running services like nping echo), it is recommended to investigate each service's best practices: ensure SSH keys are used instead of passwords where available; keep DNS software updated with security patches. Port filtering should be reconsidered especially for ports associated with Microsoft protocols as they might not align well-supported modern systems and thus could pose a risk if left open without proper oversight or configuration changes (e.g., MSRPC/netbios).
